A versatile software developer that doesn't hesitate at the opportunity to learn a new tech, library or framework, always with the end user in mind, which in most cases is a common citizen. This is the main reason that led me to specialize on frontend web development.

My journey with software started doing scientific data analysis with python, for my degree in physics. There I learned all the basics of coding, like data types, functions, scope, libraries, etc...  Then I moved into doing games with the open source engine Godot, where I learned a lot about the importance of good quality code, like modularity, single responsibility, decoupling, coding patterns, etcâ€¦
Finally, I decided to start doing web development, mainly frontend using React, and it really is a never ending journey. I aspire to be the best version of me that I can achieve, always with my main priority of delivering great quality software and code.
